# RoomFix - Hostel Complaint Management System

**RoomFix** is a high-performance, minimalist, and student-centric hostel maintenance request system designed to streamline the communication between students and hostel administration. 

Built with **AngularJS**, **Node.js**, and **MongoDB**, RoomFix offers a seamless and professional interface for reporting issues and managing hostel facilities.

## 🏗️ Project Architecture

RoomFix follows a classic **Single Page Application (SPA)** architecture for a fast and reactive user experience.

1.  **Frontend (AngularJS 1.x)**: 
    - The client-side logic is handled by a single AngularJS module (`roomfixApp`).
    - **Routing**: `ngRoute` manages navigation without page reloads.
    - **Controllers**: Dedicated controllers for Login, Registration, Student Dashboard, Admin Panel, and Complaint Submission.
    - **Service Layer**: A centralized `DataService` handles all `$http` requests to the backend.
2.  **Backend (Node.js & Express)**:
    - A RESTful API provides endpoints for data manipulation and authentication.
    - Uses **Express 5.x** for routing and middle-ware.
    - Serves static files and templates from the project root and `views/`.
3.  **Database (MongoDB Atlas)**:
    - A cloud-hosted MongoDB Atlas instance provides scalable storage.
    - **Direct Driver Usage**: The application uses the official `mongodb` driver for high-performance data access.

## 🛡️ Security Best Practices
- **Data Privacy**: Student email addresses and SAP IDs are kept confidential.
- **Role-Based Access**: Front-end routes and back-end APIs are separated by role logic.
- **Image Handling**: Maximum file size limit (10MB) applied to prevent server overload.
